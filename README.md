# esi-course-utwente

read installation as in installation-guide or just look at the website (link: https://thesethtruth.github.io/esi-course-utwente/intro.html)

pyproject.toml is used to build the site, use UV for that

jupyter-book builds workshop site (<2 version because does not work otherwise)
