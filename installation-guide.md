# Installation guide: Energy System Intergration

This guide will help you installing Python on your computer. Additionally, it will help you install VSCode as IDE (interactive development environment) and Poetry as environment manager. Below is a short introduction, why you need these three components and what they do.


> **Note:** You are completely free to choose your own IDE and package manager or even OS as long as you can use [PyPSA](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html). This guide is written for Windows. 

## Explainer: Why Python, VScode and Poetry?

To get started with programming and projects like PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis), you'll need a few key tools. Hereâ€™s why Python, VSCode, and Poetry are essential:

### Python
**What is Python?**
Python is a popular, easy-to-learn programming language used for many applications.

**Why do you need Python?**
- **Core Language**: PyPSA is written in Python, so you need it to run and modify PyPSA. Without installing Python, we can't run Python code or modules.
- **Libraries**: Python has many libraries that simplify tasks. Poetry helps manage these libraries easily.

### VSCode (Visual Studio Code)
**What is VSCode?**
VSCode is a free, powerful code editor developed by Microsoft.

**Why do you need VSCode?**
- **Easy Coding**: Features like syntax highlighting and code completion make writing Python code simpler.
- **Seamless Integration**: VSCode works well with Python and Poetry, helping you run and manage your projects directly from the editor.

### Poetry
**What is Poetry?**
Poetry manages your Python projects, handling dependencies and virtual environments.

**Why do you need Poetry?**
- **Manage Libraries**: Easily install and update libraries for your projects.
- **Organize Projects**: Keeps your project dependencies isolated and organized, which is crucial when working in VSCode.

These tools work together to make your programming experience smoother and more enjoyable.

Remember, this guide is for Windows, but you can use these tools on any operating system. Happy coding!

## Installation steps

### Step 1 - Install Python 

Install Python 3.12 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. If you don't know which version you need, you will probably be using the [64-bit AMD version](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.7/python-3.12.7-amd64.exe).

### Step 2 - Install Poetry 

You can follow the official guide on [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx), or the steps below.

#### Install pipx
```bash
py -m pip install --user pipx
```

It is possible (even most likely) the above finishes with a WARNING looking similar to this:
```
WARNING: The script pipx.exe is installed in `<USER folder>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python3x\Scripts` which is not on PATH
``` 
If so, go to the mentioned folder, allowing you to run the pipx executable directly. Enter the following line (even if you did not get the warning):
```bash
.\pipx.exe ensurepath
```
#### Install poetry
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

### Step 3 - Install VScode

Download and install VScode from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

#### Recommended: Install extensions
This will make your life easier. Use the extensions tab on the left side (the blocks) to install:
1. **Python (Microsoft)**  
   *Linting, syntax highlighting and suggestions*
2. **Jupyter (Microsoft)**  
   *Allows you to run code interactively and easier debugging*

### Step 4 - Open a folder in VScode and start your project

Make a folder on your desired location. For instance, I use `C:\Users\Seth\coding\esi-course`.

Open this folder in VScode (through `File>Open Folder...` or `CTRL+K` and then `CTRL+O`).

### Step 5 - Download the contents of this course repo

Navigate to https://github.com/thesethtruth/esi-course-utwente and use the code button to download the course content as a .zip. Unzip this folder directly in the folder of you choice. 

#### Alternatively you can use Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesethtruth/esi-course-utwente.git .
```

### Step 6 - Install all dependencies using Poetry 
Make sure you are in the right folder (the one that you just downloaded) and run this command:

```bash
# /esi-course-utwente
poetry install
```

This will install all the dependencies. Activate the environment with:

```
poetry shell
```
Select this environment as your Python interpreter in VSCode by using: `CRTL+SHIFT+P` and select the environment name from the list (you should see it in front of your terminal). If you can't see it, type `which python` in your terminal and use the option `Enter interpreter path...`. Paste the output of the `which python` in there. 

### Step 7 - Validate your installation

Run the example from lecture 6 directly using the Play button on top of the screen when you open the Python file. Or use the terminal directly: `python lecture-6/lecture-6-case-example.py`. This should run without errors.

#### Run it interactively
Use the Jupyter extension to run the file interactively. To do this, open the file and use `CRTL+SHIFT+P` > `Jupyter: Run Current File in Interactive Window`. This will open an interactive window, where you can explore variable, rerun code and inspect plots. 

#### Optionally: add a shortcut for running interactively

Normally, I run most of my code interactively with Jupyter because it is easier to develop and debug code while writing. For that reason, I have a keyboard shortcut (`SHIFT+ENTER`) that runs the Python file interactively.

To also use this, use `CRTL+SHIFT+P` > `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` and add this (only the part between the curly brackets):

```json
[
    ...
    {
        "key": "shift+enter",
        "command": "jupyter.runFileInteractive",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && !findInputFocussed && !jupyter.ownsSelection && !notebookEditorFocused && !replaceInputFocussed && editorLangId == 'python'"
    },
    ...
]
```
